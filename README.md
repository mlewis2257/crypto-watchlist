# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<p>
    The Crypto Watchlist App uses the MERN Tech Stack for a full frontend and backend. It's built using the MVC architecture to keep a consistent flow on how data is being pulled from the Coin Stats API, being feed through the backend server and render on to the users screen. User data is being stored in the MongoDB database and I used the bcyrpt hash library to help with password hashing and matching the user-email and password with that in the database.

    The functionality of this app allows you to view the crypto currency market data on the top 20 coins on the market. You can also see the prices that crypto has been from the present day to year a prior. All coin information is known as well like market cap, total supply, 1h price change, etc.

    The Ice Box Features:
        - Live price data changes and animations to render change.
        - User Profile Settings
        - Add a personal coin watchlist w/ notifications
        - News on Specific coin in Details Page
        - Market and Ethereum gas updates live
        - Exchanges where to buy specific coins
