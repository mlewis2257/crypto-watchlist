    The Crypto Watchlist App uses the MERN Tech Stack for a full frontend and backend. It's built using the MVC architecture to keep a consistent flow on how data is being pulled from the Coin Stats API, being feed through the backend server and render on to the users screen. User data is being stored in the MongoDB database and I used the bcyrpt hash library to help with password hashing and matching the user-email and password with that in the database.

    The functionality of this app allows you to view the crypto currency market data on the top 20 coins on the market. You can also see the prices that crypto has been from the present day to year a prior. All coin information is known as well like market cap, total supply, 1h price change, etc.

    The Ice Box Features:
        - Live price data changes and animations to render change.
        - User Profile Settings
        - Add a personal coin watchlist w/ notifications
        - News on Specific coin in Details Page
        - Market and Ethereum gas updates live
        - Exchanges where to buy specific coins
